      <p>This is an investigation into whether or not we can predict if a student will receive an offer of admission based on the student data provided: GPA, GRE, TOEFL, Major, College Region, College Name, State, Domestic/International status, and Gender.</p>
      <p>I found that it was possible to make a prediction of admission using a given student's profile with 85% accuracy, but that there are some pitfalls in the data that could be rectified, and additional data that could be collected in order to make this analysis and future modeling more robust.</p>

      <p>Here we can see that Applications for the Analytics program come from all over the world! A majority of these are clearly from the United States and China. With such a concentrated distribution in only two locations, it is likely that location at the national/regional level will not be a major factor in determining whether a student will receive an offer of admission. Additionally in considering data consistency issues with some of the geographic data (further explored in the Conclusion and Next Steps section), it may be more helpful to use the domestic/international status of the applicant instead of the region. For domestic applicants there is also state level information so we can also visualize where those applications come from as well:</p>

      <p>There are a lot of applications from California, which could also be due to the fact that California is a high population state. As I state in the further work section, it could be useful to normalize these values by population to paint a more accurate portrait of potential outlier states, rather than emphasizing high population states. Next, we'll see if these locations play any role in admission rates:</p>
      <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1558406203425' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;st&#47;students_15582965441960&#47;admitrates&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='students_15582965441960&#47;admitrates' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;st&#47;students_15582965441960&#47;admitrates&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1558406203425');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
	  <p>Here we can see that admit rates do vary a lot between domestic and international applicants; domestic applicants were more than 1.5 times more likely to receive offers of admission compared to their international peers. Let's see if this extends to gender:</p>
    <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1558407857670' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;st&#47;students_15582965441960&#47;gender&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='students_15582965441960&#47;gender' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;st&#47;students_15582965441960&#47;gender&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1558407857670');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
      <p>Here we can see that there isn't much of a difference between the admit rates of males and females, although females are slightly more likely to apply and are also admitted at slightly higher rates. Next let's take a look at the distribution of numeric values in the dataset:</p>
      <div class="w3-center" style="max-width:900px">
        <img src="/mini-project/images/dist.png" class="w3-image w3-padding-32 w3-center" width="600" height="650" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Distribution of GPA, GRE, and TOEFL scores">
      </div>
      <p>Here we can see that GPA scores are somewhat normally distributed, but are left skewed with a long tail. GRE scores are highly concentrated at the upper end of the scale, while TOEFL scores appear to be pretty normally distributed and centered around about 105. It would be interesting to compare these to undergraduates in general to see how Georgetown applicants look compared to other graduate school applicants or other college graduates more generally.</p>

  <!-- Hypotheses -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-grey w3-padding-32 w3-padding-large" id="hyp">
    <div class="w3-content" style="max-width:900px">
      <h4 class="w3-center"><b>Hypothesis</b></h4>
      <p class="w3-center">“We can use the variables in this provided dataset to determine whether a student will receive an offer of admission.”</p>
      <p class="w3-center"><b>Method 1: Logistic Regression</b></p>
      <p class="w3-center">With this method I was able to predict admission rates with 46% accuracy.</p>
      <p class="w3-center"><b>Method 2: Decision Tree</b></p>
      <p class="w3-center">With this method I was able to predict admission rates with 49% accuracy.</p>
      <p class="w3-center"><b>Method 3: Naive Bayes</b></p>
      <p class="w3-center">With this method I was able to predict admission rates with 85% accuracy.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Hypothesis 1 -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-padding-large" id="h1">
    <div class="w3-content" style="max-width:900px">
        <h4 class="w3-center"><b>Method 1: Logistic Regression</b></h4>
        <p>This method was not particularly useful for prediction, but did provide some interesting insights on which variables were useful to this analysis. Here is the model:</p>
        <div class="w3-center" style="max-width:900px">
        <img src="/mini-project/images/logres_offer_var.png" class="w3-image w3-padding-32 w3-center" width="600" height="650" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Logistic Regression Model">
        </div>
        <p>From this model we can see that the applicant's GPA and TOEFL scores were extremely significant, and the applicant's GRE score was also moderately significant. Other factors like major, gender, and domestic/international status were not considered significant. This aligns with the exploratory analysis above which found similar admit rates across gender and major, although I did think that domestic/international status could play a small role, since admit rates were higher amongst domestic applicants. This information could be useful in future determinations of which data is useful to collect and maintain.</p>
        <p>I split the data in a 90% train set and 10% test set of 342 and 39 observations respectively. Here is the confusion matrix for the predictions of the model on the test data that was held back in training:</p>
        <div class="w3-center" style="max-width:900px">
        <img src="/mini-project/images/logres_offer_conf.png" class="w3-image w3-padding-32 w3-center" width="350" height="300" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Logistic Regression Confusion Matrix">
        </div>
        <p>Here we can see that the overall error rate is 54%, and this model had a particularly poor true positive rate at 6/24 or 25%.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Hypothesis 2 -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-grey w3-padding-32 w3-padding-large" id="h2">
    <div class="w3-content" style="max-width:900px">
      <h4 class="w3-center"><b>Method 2: Decision Tree</b></h4>
      <p>Again, this method was not particularly useful but did provide a highly interpretable tree which could be useful in future variable selection or model development.</p>
      <div class="w3-center" style="max-width:900px">
      <img src="/mini-project/images/tree_offer.png" class="w3-image w3-padding-32 w3-center" width="600" height="650" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Decision Tree">
      </div>
      <p>Here we can see that certain elements of an applicant's profile are likely to lead to a favorable or unfavorable application. Favorable elements include a GPA greater than 3.79, and a GRE above 169.5 (likely a perfect score!). Unfavorable elements include a TOEFL score below 101.5 and a GRE score below 167.5. These could provide some intuitive cutoff points in comparing applicants and their likelihood of receiving admission.</p>
      <p>However, this was not a particularly useful method in terms of prediction on the test set:</p>
      <div class="w3-center" style="max-width:900px">
        <img src="/mini-project/images/tree_offer_conf.png" class="w3-image w3-padding-32 w3-center" width="350" height="300" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Decision Tree Confusion Matrix">
      </div>
      <p>The error rate for this model was about 51%, which was not a significant improvement over the logistic regression model. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Hypothesis 3 -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-light-grey w3-padding-32" id="h3">
    <h4 class="w3-center"><b>Method 3: Naive Bayes</b></h4>
    <p >Of the three methods tested, this was the simplest and also the most performant. It didn't provide much output that would be useful in other analyses but would be useful in analyzing whether an un-evaluated student would be likely to receive an offer of admission. Here is the confusion matrix for this method on the test set:</p>
    <div class="w3-center" style="max-width:900px">
        <img src="/mini-project/images/nb_offer_conf.png" class="w3-image w3-padding-32 w3-center" width="350" height="300" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Naive Bayes Confusion Matrix">
      </div>
    <p>The error rate for this model was only 15%, which is an encouraging indicator that there are important elements in this data that can be used to predict offers of admission with some accuracy. Still, I think there is a lot of room for improvement, particularly in reducing the number of false positives present in this set. I think with addition data and the further work noted below, it would be possible to improve upon this score.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

 
   <!-- Conclusion -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-dark-grey w3-text-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-padding-large" id="conclusion">
    <div class="w3-content" style="max-width:600px">
      <h4 class="w3-center"><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
      <p class="w3-center">In this case I was able to predict whether a student would receive an offer of admission with about 85% accuracy using the variables GPA, GRE, TOEFL, Major, Domestic/International status, and Gender.</p>
      <p class="w3-center">However, there is still a lot of future work to be done. The location data was very messy and included misspelled states and incorrect geography levels (e.g. Latin America under region, while all others were nations.) In the future it would be more useful to have standardized college names and locations and potentially use approimate Latitutde/Longitude to facilitate better use of this geographic data in both visualization and analysis. Even with the current geographic data, it could be helpful to normalize the number of applications by population - this would help place areas like China and California application rates in the context of their region. It would also be useful to collect all of this data over time, so that there is more information to model with; it would also enable us to conduct longitudinal analyses to see how the admissions landscape has changed over time.</p>
      <p class="w3-center">In addition to the standardization of geographic data and additional years of data, I would advocate for the collection of new data. It would be helpful to have additional metrics such as a score (or even the raw text) of the student's admission essay. We know that the essay plays a large role in admissions and in this case there isn't any information on it for us to analyze. It would also be helpful to include metrics about whether the student attended information sessions or spoke with admissions officers, as this might indicate interest levels that could help us better understand how serious they are about their application and potentially even how likely they are to matriculate.</p>
      <p class="w3-center">I also tried to see if there was any interesting information that could be derived from association rule mining of this data (see codebase below), but the only main insight I found was that Management majors tend to be from China moreso than any other region. It is an interesting result, but I think it could be significantly mroe pwerful if there were additional variables in this data as outlined above.</p>
      <p class="w3-center">Last, it would of course be useful to test additional models on this set to drive further insights. For example, a naive bayes tree may do a better job at prediction, without having to sacrifice the interpretability of the decision tree above. It is also worth looking into other variables for modeling; in this case I did not try to predict matriculation based on a student's profile, but I think with additional data about the student population at large it could be easier to identify what makes a student likely to gain and accept an offer of admission to Georgetown's Analytics program.</p>
